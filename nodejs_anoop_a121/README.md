## Dockerfile (Docker Image)

This Dockerfile is used to create a Docker image for a Node.js application. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

- `FROM node:13-alpine`: This line specifies the base image to use, which is Node.js version 13 based on Alpine Linux. Alpine Linux is a lightweight distribution, making this image relatively small.

- `RUN mkdir -p /usr/app`: It creates a directory `/usr/app` within the container where the application code will be placed.

- `COPY package*.json /usr/app/`: This line copies the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files from your local directory into the container's `/usr/app/` directory. These files are necessary for installing Node.js dependencies.

- `COPY app /usr/app/`: It copies the application code (your Node.js application files) into the container's `/usr/app/` directory.

- `WORKDIR /usr/app`: This sets the working directory within the container to `/usr/app`.

- `EXPOSE 3000`: It exposes port 3000 to allow external connections to the Node.js application.

- `RUN npm install`: This installs the Node.js dependencies defined in `package.json`.

- `CMD ["node", "server.js"]`: Finally, it specifies the command to run when the container starts. In this case, it runs the `server.js` file using Node.js.

## Kubernetes Deployment (deployment.yaml)

This Kubernetes Deployment configuration deploys the Node.js application as a set of containers within pods. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

- `apiVersion` and `kind`: These fields specify the Kubernetes API version and resource type (Deployment).

- `metadata`: This section provides metadata for the Deployment, including its name and labels.

- `spec`: The specification for the Deployment includes the following details:

  - `selector`: This defines how the Deployment selects which pods to manage. In this case, it selects pods with the label `app: nodeapp`.

  - `template`: The pod template that defines how the pods should be created.

    - `metadata`: Metadata for the pods, including labels.

    - `spec`: Specifications for the pods, including the container(s) to run.

      - `imagePullSecrets`: This section allows specifying Docker image pull secrets if needed.

      - `containers`: This defines the containers to run within the pods.

        - `name`: The name of the container.

        - `image`: The Docker image to use for the container.

        - `ports`: Port configuration, specifying that the container listens on port 3000.

        - `imagePullPolicy`: Specifies that the image should always be pulled to ensure the latest version is used.

## Kubernetes Service (service.yaml)

### Service Contents
This Kubernetes Service configuration defines a ClusterIP service to expose the Node.js application within the cluster. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

- `apiVersion` and `kind`: These fields specify the Kubernetes API version and resource type (Service).

- `metadata`: Metadata for the service, including its name and labels.

- `spec`: Specifications for the service, including:

  - `type: ClusterIP`: This sets the service type to ClusterIP, which exposes the service only within the cluster.

  - `selector`: This specifies the label selector to target pods with the label `app: nodeapp`.

  - `ports`: Port configuration, mapping port 3000 on the service to port 3000 on the pods running the Node.js application.

## ServiceMonitor (monitoring.yaml)

This Kubernetes ServiceMonitor configuration is used to define how monitoring should collect metrics from the Node.js application. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

- `apiVersion` and `kind`: These fields specify the Kubernetes API version and resource type (ServiceMonitor).

- `metadata`: Metadata for the ServiceMonitor, including its name and labels.

- `spec`: Specifications for the ServiceMonitor, including:

  - `endpoints`: Defines where to collect metrics from the application.

    - `path`: Specifies the path to the metrics endpoint.

    - `port`: The port on the service to target for metrics.

    - `targetPort`: The target port on the pods to collect metrics from.

  - `namespaceSelector`: Specifies the namespaces to monitor. In this case, it matches the "default" namespace.

  - `selector`: Label selector to target pods with the label `app: nodeapp`.

This README provides an overview of the Dockerfile and Kubernetes configuration files used to deploy a Node.js application within a Kubernetes cluster. Make sure to customize these files according to your specific application and environment.
